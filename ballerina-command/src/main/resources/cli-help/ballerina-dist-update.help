NAME
       ballerina-dist-update - Update to the latest patch version of the active distribution

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina dist update


DESCRIPTION
       Update fetches the latest patch version of your active distribution with its dependency and marks it
       as the active version.

       This command does not fetch the latest minor version if any.


EXAMPLES

       new patch version jballerina-1.1.7. Then, the following command will fetch
       it with its dependency and mark it as the active distribution.
          $ ballerina dist update
